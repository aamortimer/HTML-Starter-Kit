## Gulp
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) has been set up to compile SCSS, JavaScript and create sprites.

To get started with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) you will firstly need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
on to your system. Visit [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) for installation instructions.

Once you have this installed open up your terminal and navigate into the folder where you installed this starter
kit and type ```npm install``` this will install all the necessary packages that gulp relies on. Once that has finished you will be ready to run gulp.
To run gulp type ```gulp``` into the your terminal window, this will tell gulp to watch for any changes and re-compile all SCSS and JavaScript.

and delete any that you do not need.
